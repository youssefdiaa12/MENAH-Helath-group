how can we know that the current child that we failed to scan QR Code is the relevant child to the mother's we are going to scan her ID.

should we make it automatically calculated CGA and DOB?

Gravida	How many times the mother has been pregnant (includes current pregnancy and even miscarriages).
Para	How many times the mother has given birth after 20 weeks of pregnancy (regardless of outcome: alive or stillborn).
Abortion	How many times the mother has lost pregnancy before 20 weeks (miscarriages or induced abortions).
Type of Delivery	How the baby was delivered â€” like Normal Delivery, C-section (Cesarean), Vacuum, etc.

why should i wrote order while i can automatically calculated by getting count of bottles generated for this mother , initialize the beginning by 0 and every bottle increase by 1.
